# Load Balancer

Load Balancer is a hardware or software used to distribute the traffic to the servers in a balanced way and is placed in front of the servers. The load balancer is a very important component of an organization due to its duty. Continuing the services of the organization uninterrupted can be very critical for the organization. Therefore, for access security, load balancer devices/software should be placed in the necessary parts and correctly configured and monitored. Otherwise, the services of the organization may be interrupted, causing the organization to experience a loss of prestige or financial loss. For example, if we consider that DoS/DDoS attacks are aimed at preventing the services of the organization, we can more easily understand the importance of load balancers in this sense.
DoS (Denial of Service): It is called attacking to render the service inoperable by sending more network traffic than the target system can handle. In short, it can be said to cause disruption of the service provided by consuming resources towards the target.


Some popular Load Balancer products used in the cyber security industry are as follows:

- Nginx
- F5
-  Citrix
- Azure Traffic Manager
- AWS
