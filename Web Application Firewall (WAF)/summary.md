# Web Application Firewall 

Web Application Firewall (WAF) is security software or hardware that monitors, filters, and blocks incoming packets to a web application and outgoing packets from a web application.
It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others.


# Types of WAF

1. Network-based WAF- Network-based WAF is a security product that is hardware-based on the relevant network. It needs staff to write rules on it and to maintain it. Although it is an effective WAF product, it is more expensive than other WAF products.


2. Host-based WAF- Host-based WAF is a cheaper product than network-based WAF. It is a WAF with more customization possibilities. Considering that it is a software product, it consumes the resources of the server it is on. It may be more difficult to maintain and the systems on it must be securely hardened.


3. Cloud-based WAF- Cloud-based WAF is a much more convenient and easy-to-apply security solution than other WAF products purchased as an external service. Since the maintenance and updates of the WAF product belong to the service area, there are no additional costs such as cost and maintenance. However, it is a matter to be considered that the cloud-based WAF product that is serviced has sufficient customizations suitable for you.


Some popular WAF products used in the cybersecurity industry are as follows:

- AWS
- Cloudflare
- F5
- Citrix
- Fortiweb
