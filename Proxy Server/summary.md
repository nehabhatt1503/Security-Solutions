# Proxy Server

A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network.

Some people use proxies for personal purposes, such as hiding their location while watching movies online, for example. For a company, however, they can be used to accomplish several key tasks such as:

Improve security
Secure employees’ internet activity from people trying to snoop on them
Balance internet traffic to prevent crashes
Control the websites employees and staff access in the office
Save bandwidth by caching files or compressing incoming traffic

## How a Proxy Works
Because a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge


## Types of Proxy Servers

1. Forward Proxy Server- Forward Proxy Server is the most widely used proxy server type. It is used to direct requests from a private network to the internet with a firewall.


2. Transparent Proxy Server- A transparent Proxy Server is a proxy server that directs requests and responses to the target without making changes to incoming/outgoing requests and responses.


3. Anonymous Proxy Server- Anonymous Proxy Server is a proxy server that enables anonymous browsing on the internet.


4. High Anonymity Proxy Server- A high Anonymity Proxy Server is a proxy server that makes it difficult to track the client with higher confidentiality without sending the proxy server type and client IP address information in the request.


5. Distorting Proxy Server- A distorting Proxy Server is a proxy server that tries to hide its identity by defining itself as the proxy server of a website. By changing the real IP address, the confidentiality of the client is tried to be ensured.


6. Data Center Proxy Server- Data-Center Proxy Server is a special proxy server that is used as a proxy server that is not connected to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) by getting service over data centers. It is a proxy server that is insufficient to provide anonymity. It has a quick response feature.


7. Residential Proxy Server -A residential Proxy Server is a proxy server that passes all requests made by the client. Thanks to this proxy server, unwanted and suspicious advertisements can be blocked. It is more secure than other proxy servers.


8. Public Proxy Server -A public Proxy Server is a free proxy server available to everyone. It is ideal for those looking for a cost-free proxy server by sacrificing security and speed. It's insecure because it's accessible to everyone, and it's also slow.


9. Shared Proxy Server- A Shared Proxy Server is a proxy server that more than one person can use at the same time. It is preferred for fast connection and cost-free use. The disadvantage of this proxy server is that it is used by many people at the same time, so the activity of any user can affect another. For example, after the activity of one of the users, the IP address of this proxy server may be blocked by a server. In this case, access to the blocking server cannot be provided by all persons using the proxy server.


10. SSL Proxy Server- SSL Proxy Server is a proxy server in which the communication between client and server is provided in a bidirectional encrypted manner. It can be said to be safe because it provides encrypted communication against threats.


11. Rotating Proxy Server -A rotating Proxy Server is a proxy server where a separate IP address is assigned to each client.


12. Reverse Proxy Server- A reverse Proxy Server is a proxy server that validates and processes transactions so that the client does not communicate directly. The most popular reverse proxy servers are "Varnish" and "Squid".


13. Split Proxy Server -A split Proxy Server is a proxy server that runs as two programs installed on two different computers.


14. Non-Transparent Proxy Server- A non-transparent Proxy Server is a proxy server that works by sending all requests to the firewall. Clients using this proxy server are aware that requests are sent over the firewall.


15. Hostile Proxy Server- A hostile Proxy Server is a proxy server used to eavesdrop on traffic between client and target on the web.


16. Intercepting Proxy Server- Intercepting Proxy Server is a proxy server that allows using proxy server features and gateway features together.


17. Forced Proxy Server -A forced Proxy Server is a proxy server where blocking and allowing policies are applied together.


18. Caching Proxy Server- A Caching Proxy Server is a proxy server that has a caching mechanism it and returns a response in accordance with this caching mechanism in response to the requests sent by the clients.


19. Web Proxy Server -A web Proxy Server is a proxy server that works on web traffic.


20. Socks Proxy Server -A socks Proxy Server is a proxy server that prevents external network components from obtaining information about the client.


21. HTTP Proxy Server- HTTP Proxy Server is a proxy server with a caching mechanism for HTTP protocol.
