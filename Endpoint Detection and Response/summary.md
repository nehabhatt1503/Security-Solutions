# Endpoint Detection and Response

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), also called endpoint detection and threat response (EDTR), is an endpoint security solution that continuously monitors end-user devices to detect and respond to cyber threats like ransomware and malware.

## How does EDR work?
EDR security solutions record the activities and events taking place on endpoints and all workloads, providing security teams with the visibility they need to uncover incidents that would otherwise remain invisible. An EDR solution should provide continuous and comprehensive visibility into what is happening on endpoints in real time. An EDR tool should offer advanced threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities: including incident data search and investigation alert triage, suspicious activity validation, threat hunting, and malicious activity detection and containment.

## EDR Core Components

- Endpoint data collection agents
- Automated response
- Analysis and forensics


Some popular EDR products used within the cybersecurity industry are as follows:
